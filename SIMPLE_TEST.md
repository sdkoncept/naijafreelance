# 🧪 Simple Test - This Will Definitely Show Something!

## New Test Page Created!

I've created a simple test page that will **definitely** show you what's happening.

---

## ✅ Upload the New Build

**I just rebuilt with a test page. Upload this:**

1. **Delete all old files** on your server
2. **Upload the new `dist/` folder** from: `/home/aanenih/Cursor Projects/naijafreelance/dist/`
3. **Clear browser cache** (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)

---

## 🧪 Test the Key

### Step 1: Visit the Test Page

**Go to:** http://naijafreelance.sdkoncept.com/paystack-test

**This page will show:**
- ✅ If the key is found
- ❌ If the key is missing
- All details about the key

### Step 2: Check the Page

**You should see a page with:**
- "Paystack Key Test" heading
- A gray box showing:
  - Key Value: `pk_test_...` or "NOT FOUND"
  - Key Type: string/undefined
  - Is Undefined: YES/NO
  - Is Empty: YES/NO
  - etc.

### Step 3: Check Console

1. **Press F12** (open console)
2. **Go to Console tab**
3. **You should see:**
   ```
   🧪 PaystackTest Page Loaded!
   🔑 Key from import.meta.env: pk_test_...
   📦 Full import.meta.env: {...}
   ```

## What to Tell Me

**After visiting `/paystack-test`, tell me:**

1. **What does the page show?**
   - Does it say "NOT FOUND" or does it show the key?
   - What does "Key Value" show?

2. **What does the console show?**
   - Copy the messages you see (especially the `🔑 Key from import.meta.env:` line)

3. **Can you see the test page at all?**
   - If you get a 404, the route isn't working
   - If you see the page, it's working

---

## This Will Tell Us Everything!

**This test page will show us:**
- ✅ If the key is in the build
- ✅ If Vite replaced the variable correctly
- ✅ What the actual value is
- ✅ If there's a problem with how it's being read

**Visit `/paystack-test` and tell me what you see!** 🚀
